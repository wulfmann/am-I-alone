# Am I Alone?

This project is heavily inspired by [turven](https://turven.xyz).

> Ever wondered if you're the only person in the whole world reading a web page?

> Chances are, in a wonderful moment of serendipity, there may be another soul, somewhere on this planet, also reading the same page as you are, at the very same moment.
